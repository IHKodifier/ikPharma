# GEMINI Project Analysis: ik_pharma

## Project Overview

This is a Flutter project for **ikPharma**, a comprehensive, three-tier SaaS pharmacy management platform. The application is designed for scale and serves roles from single stores to large chains with Trial, Paid, and Enterprise subscription tiers.

The frontend is built with **Flutter** and utilizes the **Riverpod** package for state management.

The backend is heavily integrated with **Firebase**, specifically using **Firebase Data Connect** to interface with a PostgreSQL database. The `README.md` also mentions a FastAPI (Python) backend, but the immediate infrastructure configured in this repository is centered around Firebase services. The project is configured to use the Firebase Local Emulator Suite for Data Connect.

## Building and Running

### Flutter Application

-   **Get dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

-   **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

-   **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```

### Firebase Backend (Data Connect)

The project uses the Firebase CLI (`firebase-tools`) for managing the backend.

-   **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

-   **Run the local Firebase emulators:**
    ```bash
    npm exec firebase emulators:start
    ```

-   **Deploy to Firebase:**
    ```bash
    # Note: Ensure you are logged into the correct Firebase account first.
    npm exec firebase deploy
    ```

## Development Conventions

-   **State Management:** The project uses `flutter_riverpod`, indicating a reactive and declarative approach to managing application state.
-   **Code Style:** The presence of `flutter_lints` suggests adherence to the standard Dart and Flutter style guides. Code should be formatted and analyzed according to these rules.
-   **Firebase Integration:** The application initializes Firebase at startup. The `firebase_options.dart` file contains project-specific configurations for different platforms (Android, iOS, Web, etc.).
-   **Data Layer:** The primary data access method from the Flutter app is via the `firebase_data_connect` package, which communicates with the GraphQL-based API defined in the `/dataconnect` directory. All data models and mutations should be defined in the `dataconnect/schema/schema.gql` file.
